## How to Make Items Appear in the New Sections

All three blocks are filled automatically from *the same JSON files* you already use (`tools.json`, `bots.json`, etc.).  
Just tweak or add the fields below—**no extra file, no new arrays**—and hit *Save → Refresh*.

| Section                | What the JavaScript Looks For                     | Exactly What to Put in the Item Object                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **🔥 Offers & Discounts** | ‑ `discount` **or** `offer` is **present and not expired** | ```json { "name": "Combo Splitter", "discount": "30", "discount_expiry": "2025-05-05T23:59:00Z" } ```<br>or<br>```json { "name": "Log Extractor Pro", "offer": "Buy 1 Get 1", "offer_expiry": "2025-04-30T18:00:00Z" } ``` |
| **⭐ Recommended**      | 1) Item has the tag **`"recommended"`** **OR**<br>2) Its `release_date` is within the last 14 days | **Option A (best):**<br>```json "tags": ["extractor", "recommended"] ```<br>**Option B:** (no tag needed)<br>Set `"release_date"` to a date ≤ 14 days ago, e.g. `"2025-04-10"` |
| **⏰ Limited-Time Item** | `stock` equals **1**                             | ```json { "stock": 1 } ```                                                                           |

*(You can combine them—an item with `discount` **and** `stock: 1` will show in both relevant sections.)*

### Step-by-Step

1. **Open** the JSON file that contains the product (for example, `data/tools.json`).  
2. **Find** the object for that tool, or create a new one.  
3. **Add/Edit** the fields shown above.  
4. **Save** the file.  
5. **Hard-refresh** the site (Ctrl/⌘-Shift-R) so the service worker grabs the new data.

That’s it—the JavaScript already watches those fields and shows or hides each block automatically. If none of the tools meet a block’s criteria, that section stays hidden.

Need a hand with anything else—like a helper UI to toggle discounts—or validation rules? Just let me know.

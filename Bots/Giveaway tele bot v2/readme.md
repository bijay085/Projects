# Giveaway Bot - Admin Guide

Welcome to the Giveaway Bot! This guide is intended for the admin/owner/giveaway organizer. It will help you understand how to set up, run, and manage the bot for your giveaways.

## Introduction

The Giveaway Bot is designed to help you efficiently manage giveaways through Telegram. It handles participant entries, winner selection, blacklisting, disqualifications, and moreâ€”all through simple commands and interactions.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Telegram Bot Token**: Obtain one by talking to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
- **Admin IDs**: Your Telegram user ID and any other admins who will manage the bot.
- **Bot Files**: Ensure you have all the necessary bot files provided.

### Initial Setup

1. **Create a Configuration File**

   - Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as your bot files.
   - Inside the `.env` file, add the following lines:

     ```
     BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
     ADMIN_IDS=admin_id1,admin_id2
     ```

     - Replace `your_telegram_bot_token` with the token you received from BotFather.
     - Replace `admin_id1,admin_id2` with the Telegram user IDs of the admins (e.g., `123456789,987654321`).

2. **Configuring the Giveaway**

   - When you run the bot for the first time, it will prompt you to enter some configuration settings in the console.
   - These settings include:

     - **Link**: The link to the post where participants should leave feedback after receiving their reward.
     - **Ignore Time**: The amount of time (in seconds) after starting the giveaway during which entries are ignored (to prevent users from bypassing steps).
     - **Number of Winners**: The total number of winners for the giveaway.
     - **Number of Extra Winners**: Additional winners who can receive a reward if the main winners are disqualified or for any other reason.
     - **Giveaway Code**: The code that participants need to send to the bot to enter the giveaway.

   - These configurations are saved in a `config.json` file for future use.

3. **Prepare the Reward Files**

   - **Create a `cookies` Directory**: In the same folder as your bot files, create a directory named `cookies`.
   - **Add Reward Files**: Place all the reward files (e.g., `.txt` files) that you plan to send to the winners into the `cookies` directory.

4. **Start the Bot**

   - Run the bot script using your preferred method (e.g., double-clicking the script or running it from the command line).
   - The bot will start and begin listening for commands and user interactions.

## Running the Giveaway

### Starting a Giveaway

### Sending Rewards to Winners

- **Commands Requiring Confirmation**:
  - For commands that affect a user's status (`/blacklist`, `/disqualify`, `/removeb`, `/removed`), the bot will request confirmation from all admins via direct message.
  - Another admin must confirm the action by replying with 'yes' or 'no' in their private chat with the bot.

4. **Action Execution**:
   - The user is blacklisted.
   - A notification is sent to the group and to the user.

### Important Notes on Admin Commands

## FAQ

### 1. **What happens if the number of reward files is less than the number of winners?**

If the number of files in the `cookies` directory is less than the number of winners, the bot will distribute the available files by reusing the files until all winners receive one. This means the files will be cycled through for each winner. Make sure to have enough distinct reward files for a unique experience.

### 2. **Can participants be disqualified for sending the wrong code multiple times?**

Yes. If participants send the wrong giveaway code more than three times, they will automatically be disqualified from the current giveaway and receive a notification.

### 3. **What happens if participants try to enter before the ignore time is over?**

Participants who send the correct giveaway code before the ignore time has elapsed will be blacklisted for bypassing the necessary steps, such as shortlink verification. They will be prevented from participating in any future giveaways.

### 4. **Can the bot handle spamming attempts?**

Yes, the bot tracks user activity, and users who send too many messages in a short period will be warned. Repeated spam attempts will result in the user being disqualified from the current giveaway or even blacklisted from all future giveaways.

### 5. **What if an admin mistakenly disqualifies or blacklists a user?**

Admins can use the `/removeb` and `/removed` commands to remove users from the blacklist or disqualified list, respectively. Admin actions must be confirmed by another admin to ensure accountability.
